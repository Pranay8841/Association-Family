                <p>DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program preparation in class 10 depends on how you studied in class 9 for DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program. If you have covered all the topics and chapters of class 9, you can start studying class 10 topics.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        If you have wasted your 9th standard, then start DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program 2024 preparation with your missed, weakest and important chapters of DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program class 9 syllabus.
                    </strong> 
                        In class 10, your priority must be time management to crack DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program in one year. Divide your time of week into 70% of your extra study time (i.e. other than the school timing) in class 10th stuff and 30% in class 9th stuff right from the beginning to get your backlogs clear well within time. Make sure that you don’t stay behind in your current topics in the class in order to cover your backlogs.
                </p>

                <h4 class="main__heading" id="study-plan"><i class="ri-star-fill"></i>DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program 2024 Study Plan and Preparation Strategy <i class="ri-star-fill"></i></h4>

                <ul class="data__info">
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Commit to your schedule:</strong> You should have defined study sessions to ensure you are building your knowledge of the subjects instead of cramming it all at the last minute. Break down your study sessions into 45-60 mins sessions (based on how long you can concentrate) and then take a short break of 5-10 mins. Do things which you like to relax your mind. Only thing to keep in mind is – Time. Be very strict. If you are taking a 10 minute break, stick to it. No extra minutes. Go back to studies.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Identify your most productive hours:</strong> If you remember things and focus better early in the morning, then study more during that time. Studying 10-12 hours each day is not necessary for DAKSHANA Foundation. A well-concentrated 4-6 hrs of self study, other than School or Coaching time, is sometimes more than enough. Consistency is very important. Instead of studying all night one day and sleeping on the next day, it is better to study for equal hours on both days.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Clear all the basics in all subjects:</strong> Try not to skip topics. If you find any topic boring, then incorporate new effective methods of studying to make it more interesting. You can do this by active learning where you can question yourself, make flowcharts, tables and diagrams etc.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i>It is important that your basics of almost all the topics are clear and that you can tackle easy or moderate level problems in those topics, because sometimes easier questions may come from the topics which you didn’t prepare that well.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Understand concepts well and practice problems:</strong> You need consistent practice to improve speed and accuracy. Objective questions (MCQs) test your concept thoroughly. If you know that you are not very familiar with the concepts involved in the problem, don’t attempt it, rather study the concept first and then attempt the problem.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Think of different ways of solving problems:</strong> A question does not end with just getting the right answer. Instead, after getting the correct answer, you should think about how else you could have solved that problem. You can also refer to the solution after solving the problem. You may find some other alternative approach to the problem. You have to reach the solution in the fastest possible time. Learn to apply tricks in solving problems. Teachers in coaching will help you.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Appear for mock tests, and assess yourself regularly:</strong> Take a look at each test and analyse if there’s anything you can do to improve your score. The purpose of the periodic tests in coaching is to make you realise your mistakes and not to repeat them in the succeeding tests. <em>"Count the marks you lose due to silly mistakes, conceptual error, wrong interpretation of any question and other mistakes. After every test, compare it with the previous one. This will not only reduce your chance of committing a mistake but also it will motivate you as marks will increase."</em></li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Resolve your doubts quickly:</strong> If you don’t understand anything, ask the same question again and again from your teacher.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Make your own notes:</strong> Making notes is one of the best assets in DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program preparation. It’s easy and convenient to revise handmade notes in your own style and format, rather than revising from thick books and coaching modules. Make a separate notebook for remembering formulas in all three subjects.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Class notes:</strong> It's very important to go through your class notes each day after class. Things are fresh then and when you revise that time only, the whole scenario starts becoming clear. It's also directly related to your understanding in the class the next day.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Notebook for mistakes :</strong> <em>"Make a notebook containing your mistakes. Whenever you make any mistakes in a mock test or forget a concept or formula etc. note it down in this notebook. As time passes you’ll have a collection of mistakes which you aren’t supposed to commit in exams. Revise from this copy regularly. This would help you score higher."</em></li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Start revising early:</strong> It’s not just after finishing the syllabus or before the exam, revision is a continuous process during regular studies. It must happen daily in some form or other. Include a specific revision slot in your DAKSHANA Foundation - 2 year coaching program preparation schedule. Don’t procrastinate the revision time for new study.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Take proper sleep:</strong> Compromising on sleep makes you sluggish and lazy. Ideally you need 6–7 hours of sleep to get active throughout the day.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-checkbox-fill"></i><strong>Be determined, Stay positive:</strong>  There will be times when you would find it difficult to understand and manage things. Do not give up.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Note :</strong> The thing with planning and strategy is that it shouldn’t be time consuming. The time consuming part is action, you actually moving forward, and following the strategy. Don’t get confused with questions like “What to study?”, “From where should I begin?”, “When to study?”. Start with your favourite subject. It will give you confidence to prepare for the DAKSHANA Foundation exam.</p>

                <strong>Biology</strong>
                
                <p>
                    Study NCERT completely (4-5 times). Don’t forget to read every line of this book. Any line can be picked up as a question or an option. Each diagram and table is very important. Practice MCQs from NCERT. Make notes from the start and revise regularly from them.
                </p>
                                
                <strong>Mathematics</strong>
                
                <p>Continue with your NCERT and R.D Sharma books, these are very important books. If you complete the RD Sharma book and your NCERT also you will be so strong in mathematics to crack the exam, and try to solve those graphical representation questions because I’ve observed that many of the question are related to finding the co-ordinates, etc. And guys also try to solve some MCQ type question from previos yaer paper of JDST if you get it from somewhere...that’s enough.</p>

                <strong>Chemistry</strong>

                <p>Chemistry is the most scoring and easy subject in NDST.  Just continue with your NCERT Books and try to solve some high order numericals of mole concepts and the rest will be depends upon your memorising power because as we know chemistry depends upon our memorising. You can also take reference of Pradeep it will be the best.</p>

                <strong>Physics</strong>

                <p>It is little more tough and many of the students couldn’t solve those numericals.  firstly you should know how to solve numericals especially of Electricity chapter. Try to be strong at chapters like Electricity, Optics. You can also buy references like HC Verma, Dinesh , Pradeep  etc. These will be more suitable for you because it contains high order thinking skills questions and these are the question that are regularly asked in Dakshana exam. So  references are very important. First Complete your NCERT Physics and then Your reference books.</p>

                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-alert-fill" style="color: red;"></i><strong>Inconsistency in Studies :</strong> Always keep yourself up to date with what’s going on in the class, avoid falling back in the syllabus. Whatever is taught in the class, should be covered well before the next class.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-alert-fill" style="color: red;"></i><strong>Getting depressed due to low scores in tests.</strong> Don’t think about the final paper, the DAKSHANA Foundation exam, focus on doing better in the next test. It’s a gradual process of improvement till the final day of the exam. </li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-alert-fill" style="color: red;"></i><strong>Procrastination and Backlogs :</strong> Procrastination and bad habits are a sign that something has to change&hairsp;-&hairsp;whether that be the study itself or your current style of studying. Avoid backlogs. It’s okay sometimes to miss the daily study schedule, you can cover that during the week. But what’s not good is staring at your books, daydreaming, and doing nothing.</li>
                    <li class="contents__info"><i class="ri-alert-fill" style="color: red;"></i><strong>Excessive TV/ Social media/ Video games:</strong> Don't get addicted to unnecessary distractions like TV, social media, video games etc. The distractions come due to lack of interest in studies. If you badly want something, your aim is clear to achieve it. You’ll have plenty of time later to spend your time enjoying things you miss out during the preparation.</li>
